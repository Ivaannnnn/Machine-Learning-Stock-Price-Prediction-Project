# Machine-Learning-Stock-Price-Prediction-Project
# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
Introduction
Stock price prediction is a critical task for investors, analysts, and financial professionals looking to make informed decisions in the stock market. The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices using historical price data, specifically focusing on Indofood (INDF.JK), a well-known company listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

In this project, we explore the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for sequence prediction tasks. LSTM models are particularly well-suited for time-series data, such as stock prices, due to their ability to learn and remember long-term dependencies in sequential data.

The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which provides a structured approach to data mining projects. This methodology is widely used for machine learning tasks and ensures that the project is carried out systematically, starting from business understanding all the way through to deployment.

Objectives:
Predict stock prices: Using historical stock price data to forecast future prices.
Utilize LSTM: Leverage LSTM models for time-series prediction to capture the sequential dependencies in stock price movements.
Evaluation and improvement: Assess the performance of the model and explore avenues for future improvements, such as incorporating more features or fine-tuning the model.
By the end of this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that can offer valuable insights into future stock price movements, supporting better decision-making in the financial domain.
